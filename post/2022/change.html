                    <blockquote>"Everything happens for a reason <br> People change like the seasons" <br> - J.Cole</blockquote><br>
                    This is a popular quote from rapper/artist J. Cole in his song "Lost Ones" from the "Cole World: The Sideline Story" album released in September 27, 2011. <br>
                    What is about this quote that makes so popular and praised by people around the world ? <br>
                    <br>
                    As a human every one must have at least once experienced some kind of betrayal, despair, pain, humiliation or even lies and what ever they think is truly unworthy of their time existing in this world.<br>
                    <br>
                    so when J. Cole said "Everything happens for a reason" it hits home for most people, assuming the fact that the worst possible thing or the best thing ever in their lives happened for a reason, well can't judge yeah because honestly speaking half the world population love to think like that as it eases the anxiety or the stress that is being experienced by one in that moment and let's not forget that fact that most people use this term when something bad happens not often do you hear people use it when something good happens because i mean when something bad happens you want to give yourself or the person in that situation a pat on that back like<br>
                    <blockquote>"hey there everything happens for a reason"</blockquote>
                    and that is a good thing because maybe loosing this or that is the first step to gaining this or that. so you just spark a light hope with that word and just keeping hoping that there is a far more greater reason that this happened to you or who ever that person is.<br>
                    <br>
                    So now we do know that the first line talks about sparking hope and letting people feel a mental ease by making them think they are a part of something bigger.<br>
                    But what about the second line ?<br>
                    <br>
                    As i said in the start every human in existence have experienced some kind of betrayal or disappointment from some one they love or even maybe some one they looked up to their whole life.As i said in the start every human in existence have experienced some kind of betrayal or disappointment from some one they love or even maybe some one they looked up to their whole life.<br>
                    so the line "People change like the seasons" is something that every one have felt once in their life time.<br>
                    Seasons change and are supposed to change because it is the natural law of the world.<br>
                    And people also change for the greater good or evil and people should and must change because as a human everyone is deemed to change.<br>
                    Even the smallest things in the universe change. Rocks change , caterpillars change to butterflies, Seeds grow to trees, flowers or what ever, ice changes to water, water changes to vapor, even atoms change orbitals.<br>
                    And that is the natural law of the world, it is as it should be,<br>
                    i mean man kept changing the whole time, as Darwin would say from apes to hunters and gatherers. Biblically Adam even had to change , had to adapt to new style of living from those in heavens ( excuse me if i mess up the biblical stories, i skipped most of my Sunday Bible studies)<br>
                    <br>
                    so basically the point i am trying to explain is that everything is supposed to change and people do change. that is why this line hits different for most people, i mean some people might have had their backs stabbed by the one's they love or even might have made a friends of people they never thought they would.<br>
                    But i mean that is life you know.<br>
                    sometimes things happens for a reason and sometimes they don't and sometimes people change for the best or the worst.<br>
                    In this life, your life every one is deemed to experience things good or bad.<br>
                    But the thing that matters the most is how we react to it.<br>
                    <br>
                    so this two lines from one song where able to capture a lot of emotions and experiences, i mean there is a lot of stuff i would have loved to talk about but i think it is better if we end this one on this note.<br>
