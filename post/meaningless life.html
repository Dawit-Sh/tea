                    The Meaninglessness  of Life has been a long standing debate. 
                    Even some of the most influential philosophers like Socrates have struggled with the thought. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Socrates was a classical Greek philosopher who famously said 
                    <blockquote>“I know you won't believe me, but the highest form of Human Excellence is to question oneself and others”</blockquote>
                    He believed that Questioning, Observing and Reasoning are the essential components of discovery. According to Socrates, one should pursue 
                    self-exploration and never stop questioning in order to discover their own purpose or meaning in life. This theory supports the idea that 
                    life can be meaningless if one does not explore their potentials on their own terms and are unwilling to challenge themselves. But should we?, 
                    I will discuss that maybe sometime else in another blog post.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Another way people often cope with the Meaningless Of Life is through Religion; it may be an individual's way of finding hope and search for direction. 
                    Religion gives those who subscribe comfort in believing there is something indescribable beyond our human experience that connects us all, a source of 
                    peace and joy during hard times. However, this doesn't necessarily mean life has meaning. It's just a source of relief that humans have created in order 
                    to find solace during difficult times.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    No matter how much philosophical thought or religious faith we try to infuse into our lives, there remain questions left unanswered about life's ultimate 
                    meaninglessness and maddening futility. No matter how much we try to fill our lives with structure and knowledge, eventually everyone must come face-to-face 
                    with death and the potential aimlessness it brings; this inevitability leaves us without any clear answer for what comes after or why were here before hand. 
                    In the end all we really have is each other and would owe it to ourselves embrace this truth with humility.
