                    This is a common phrase I hear most of the time directed either 
                    to me or to other people in my daily life and it sometimes keeps me 
                    awake at night thinking about it. It’s complete utter bullshit (excuse my language) 
                    its a pile of garbage people say just to justify the conflict between their alter 
                    ego’s in check. Or when they just can't accept their archetype. A self justifying 
                    philosophy for people with superior complex that lurks deep within their subconscious. 
                    The fuck you want me to be happy for. If you want to then do it, if you don’t want to then don’t,
                     don’t justify your bullshit with my motive. Well lets take a deeper look at it I guess yeah 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The phrase “I do this because I want you to be happy” promises hope and refuge to the lonely, 
                    but it also carries a heavy burden; it implies that each time someone is not satisfied with 
                    their current situation, they must look outside themselves in order to find true contentment. 
                    This statement raises several questions: what the fuck does it mean, why do people say it, or 
                    are they just afraid to admit something and what is its fucking impact on happiness? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At first glance, this statement may appear to be selfless and benevolent. 
                    After all, it suggests that a person should prioritize another’s emotions 
                    above their own since genuine joy cannot be found without making sure the other person’s needs 
                    are met first. On deeper analysis though, this mantra may reveal little more than an attempt 
                    of escape from one’s own responsibility for achieving personal happiness. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Why the fuck do people use this phrase as a way of handling difficult conversations and moments? 
                    It could be argued that they may prefer pretending that every outcome is infallibly grounded in 
                    altruism instead of being honest about their motivations or desires. They might think it’s easier 
                    to accept praise for doing something out of kindness without having to acknowledge why they wanted
                     the other person to experience pleasure in the first place; no one likes confrontations so avoiding 
                     any explanation strengthens the facade. Consequently, by perpetuating this ambiguous saying anyone 
                     can avoid accountability yet maintain an air of goodness. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Whether spoken as means of shielding someone from hurtful thoughts or manipulation – there exists 
                    proof that using these words as a crutch reduces more than just stress levels. A greater 
                    consequence could be felt if this thought process becomes subconsciously entrenched since 
                    then sacrificing individual aspirations for others may become an obligation rather than being 
                    optional. This could lead people into forgetting about their goals and creating resolutions solely
                     out of the desire to please others; such illusory internalization lessens one’s probability of experiencing 
                     real happiness even if they manage to bring joy into others lives. Depressed little piece of shit.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In conclusion, “I do this because I want you to be happy” reads like a heartfelt sentiment with potentially 
                    positive consequences but in reality conveys far less profound implications namely avoiding disapproval or 
                    examining hidden feelings. These underlying intents might not always look deleterious at surface level yet 
                    conditioned acceptance certainly undermines long-term satisfaction by relying wholly on external validation 
                    rather than personalized ambitions.
