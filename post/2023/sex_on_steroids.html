                    say what… goth teen girls, depression, anxiety, rock bands, hell, drugs and too much drama 
                    my generation a failure or a social media experiment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The rise of social media has increased the presence of sex in our culture by normalizing 
                    certain ideals and forcing unrealistic standards on impressionable audiences mostly on the 
                    female audience but we are also now seeing some sparks in the male side of things too. 
                    As a result, it has created an environment that places an unhealthy emphasis on sex. Women in 
                    particular have been greatly impacted by this influx, as they are often held to higher expectations 
                    than their male counterparts, leading to a dangerous cycle of objectification in the pursuit of perfection. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In order to maintain their relevance online, women go out of their way to create 
                    sexualized images and videos that appeal to viewers. This not only increases their 
                    visibility but can also give them greater socioeconomic opportunities through sponsorships 
                    or paid collaborations. While in some instances this form of presentation is more palatable 
                    than others, at its core it is rooted in self-objectification and reinforces the notion that one 
                    must be sexually attractive to be seen or heard. With rigid beauty standards defined by a whitewashed 
                    concept of attractiveness, these behavior patterns become perpetuated within younger generations, 
                    undoing decades worth of progress towards greater acceptance and understanding amongst genders.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Apart from flaunting their appearances for internet notoriety, women also bear the burden of 
                    increased vulnerability because of the elevated attention they receive from men; rather than 
                    viewing them as people with thoughts and feelings, many still see them as objects for pleasure 
                    without any agency or control over themselves. This leads to disconcerting situations such as 
                    street harassment and cyberbullying which are largely overlooked by law enforcement and further 
                    exacerbate gender inequality, im not being a feminist or so im just speaking factz. 
                    It has become increasingly difficult for women to gain respect from 
                    society due to this relentless bombardment from digital platforms pushing them into a proverbial 
                    glass box where they’re reduced down to parts instead of being seen as whole persons, honestly they do like to be objectified too. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At the end of the day it’s up to the parents. the connection between a father and a daughter is different, *freudian thoughts intensifies*.
                    the freudian concept is something we will be discussing about some time else. but as a conclusion to this idea 
                    i want to say the rise of social media has rewired our brains into accepting ungodly ideas as an ideal into our lives. 
                    and a good example to this is how sex is the new currency for Gen Z.
