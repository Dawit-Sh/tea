                    <blockquote> Samurai Champloo is my all time favorite anime </blockquote>
                    The Samurai Champloo anime series follows the adventures of the proud and wild swordsman Mugen; 
                    a wandering ronin (so let me expand a bit on this so your lazy ass can understand, A Ronin is a 
                    samurai who has no master. Samurai were warriors from Japan long ago, and each one had a special 
                    boss who paid them to fight for him. When that person died, the samurai had no one to serve and became 
                    known as a Ronin. A wandering warrior who was looking for new work. Back to what I was saying..) in feudal Japan.
                    <br>
                    Mugen's story arc is an exploration into his inner battle between chaos and peace. The duality between his yearning 
                    for combat and his struggle to keep peace serves as a representation of the Buddhist view of seeking balance between 
                    two opposing forces. Thus, it is interesting to consider how Mugen finds peace in absurdity, despite being a character 
                    with such opposing traits. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The first way we see Mugen striving for equilibrium is through his crossroads technique - a style of fighting that has 
                    no fixed fighting form or structure, but rather attempts to absorb every single move that an opponent throws at him. 
                    This seems to be a metaphor for trying to stay as emotionless as possible — accepting any attack, regardless of how unfair 
                    or cruel it is. Through this understanding, he can gain insight into the opponent’s weaknesses and fight back without judgement.
                    We can thus take this insight more broadly — that by not resisting torture, one can overcome even their own undoing without fear or hatred.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Mugen’s view of peace also extends beyond just physical contact — it also relates to his appreciation and acceptance of all life’s eventualities. 
                    Even when facing imminent danger or peril from violent criminals, he remains unwavering in his stoic composure — seldom allowing himself to act on 
                    impulse but every so often allowing himself moments of levity and openness with his adversary in order to make sense of their situation before engaging in further hostilities.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Furthermore, we see how outer appearances are irrelevant Mugen stresses that judging people based on assumptions or mere posturing cannot be trusted because underneath surface 
                    level interactions lies a much deeper truth about whatever situation he faces (this is something we all lack). This point helps us understand why such unruly behavior was displayed 
                    in Samurai Champloo because by peering past superficiality one can find harmony amongst chaos instead of dichotomous extremes of right versus wrong which only lead further away from Finding true inner alignment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In conclusion, Mugen provides us with an example of finding balance within conflicting ideologies. He shows us how maintaining our inner composure while dealing with absurd 
                    situations will ultimately bring forth peace amcidst nihilism and incoherence provided one trusts that there is always something more beneath chaos worth exploring before making decisive decisions even 
                    if they may initially appear completely irrational or illogical upon cursory glance.
