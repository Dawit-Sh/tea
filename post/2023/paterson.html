                    <blockquote>Paterson is one of my favorite Movies.</blockquote><br>
                    Paterson is a heartfelt movie that tells the story of a man and his journey to find himself. The protagonist, Paterson, 
                    is a bus driver living in Paterson, 
                    New Jersey and the movie tells his story over the course of one week. While the film follows him from day-to-day, 
                    subtly it also shines a light on the character development of Paterson throughout this journey. <br>
                    <br>

                    Stoicism is one of the key characteristics that we can notice in Paterson’s character development. 
                    His approach to life, where he does not get worked up when stresses come his way but rather takes them head on and deals with them in an open, 
                    positive manner is something all of us can take away from this film. For example, one incident that highlights his stoic nature quite clearly is when Laura 
                    shifts her entire room into another color and has a different idea for every week; instead of complaining or getting angry with her he takes it in his stride and finds ways to make sure 
                    it works out for both of them so that they can live happily. Another example comes when he buys laura a new guitar which was expensive but certainly wasn’t needed either; again his practical mindset makes sure he optimizes 
                    his feelings Anger, Pain, Disgust to his use by writing poetry on it rather than letting it become 'dust-collector'.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    The dynamic between Paterson and wife Laura is perhaps the most interesting point about its character development. 
                    Though at times paterson feels unloved and unheard - Laura always helps him push these feelings aside by demonstrating unconditional love for 
                    him whenever he needs it. She does this through gestures like cooking him breakfast with care each morning; or by hinting out that the tasks he do find 
                    enjoyable like drinking out at Doc are her favorite parts of the day we can this in one scene where she tell him she loves the faint scent of beer after he comes back from a walk. 
                    In short one could say that it's because of Laura's unwavering love & support we see Paterson grow over time 
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    A theme we come across in Paterson’s character development arc is finding happiness in mundane activities rather than searching outside oneself; 
                    we see paterson doing things such as listening regularly to conversations around town while waiting at bus stops (to get ideas for his poems) or 
                    stopping during his daily walks just to marvel at nature unfolding before him even if briefly - find joy - without thinking about utility or rewards associated with 
                    such activities as products of our postmodern society have trained us to do so often today. Even if small insignificant things such as wiping glasses nonstop demonstrate 
                    that there's beauty even within repetition thus proving how paterson has opted for inner contentment over what society expects from us.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Overall what stands out most about paterson’s character development arc is its message encapsulated in final scene where after having to deal with disastrous 
                    happenings throughout week he still finds peace walking along uneven path keeping happy dog beside representing calmness contentment patience ; 
                    which he achieved by taking control of his emotions and only worring on the things that are under the dicotomy of his control like senca said.
